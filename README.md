# 🛡️ Shields Up: Cybersecurity Incident Response Simulation

**Role:** Information Security Analyst  
**Scenario:** Simulated ransomware attack on AIG using CISA alerts and stakeholder communication  
**Skills:** Python, CISA threat analysis, stakeholder response, incident handling

---

## 📚 Project Overview

In this cybersecurity simulation, I responded to a ransomware attack on AIG by analyzing threat intelligence alerts from the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in collaboration with the FBI and NSA.

I developed tools to:
- Parse & interpret CISA JSON threat alerts
- Notify internal stakeholders about high-priority threats
- Simulate a decryption recovery of affected files
- Document the incident timeline and response actions

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- 🐍 Python
- 🗂 JSON + CSV for alert parsing
- 📄 Text templates for stakeholder communication
- 🔐 Simulated decryption tools

---

## 🔍 Key Components

### 1️⃣ `ransomware_alert_analysis.py`  
Parses CISA alert JSON, identifies ransomware IOCs, and outputs a CSV report.

### 2️⃣ `file_decryptor_sim.py`  
Simulates decrypting a small set of compromised files.

### 3️⃣ `stakeholder_emails/`  
Email templates used to communicate with stakeholders (HR, Legal, IT, Execs).

### 4️⃣ `incident_report.md`  
Incident timeline, severity assessment, mitigation, and recovery notes.

## 📊 Outcomes

✅ Applied real-world threat intel  
✅ Demonstrated communication under crisis  
✅ Strengthened detection and response workflows  
✅ Delivered clear documentation for stakeholder and technical audiences
